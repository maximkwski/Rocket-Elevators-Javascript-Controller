# Rocket-Elevators-Javascript-Controller
This program simulates the work of Elevator.  In our case we have a Column that holds two elevators. 
And when we run our program, depends on the scenario, what our code does is finds best of two elevators  to pick user up and send to requested floor, when user request floor from the inside of elevator.
Depends on locations of elevators and if elvator's status (if it's being used or if it's on "idle") and users location and requested destination program will send the right elevator to requested floor. 
Scenarios are included in test file, that runs our program and check if it works correctly.  

The necessary files to run some tests are attached. With Node JS and NPM installed, first run:

`npm install`

and then, to run the tests:

`npm test`

With a fully completed project, you should get an output like:

All of these files can be left in your final project but no scenarios should be present in your code. The grader will run tests similar to the ones provided.
